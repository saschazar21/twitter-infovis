# Twitter Realtime Visualization

This app will stream live data from the [Twitter Streaming API](https://dev.twitter.com/streaming/overview) to visualize it with the power of [Vue](https://vuejs.org) and [Highcharts](http://www.highcharts.com/).

# Quickstart

```sh
$ git clone https://github.com/fabiandev/vue-twitter-stream-app.git
$ cd vue-twitter-stream-app
$ yarn && yarn start
```

> Also copy server/.env.example, rename it to .env and fill in your credentials.

# Live Example

[https://ivapp.herokuapp.com/](https://ivapp.herokuapp.com/)

> Since the app is hosted on a free [Heroku](https://www.heroku.com/) instance, it may need some time to boot up.
> Please also note, that due to restrictions of the Twitter streaming API, only one concurrent stream is allowed.

*Fun fact:* The app is named "iv", because the course at University, where this project was born,
was called "Information Visualisation".
